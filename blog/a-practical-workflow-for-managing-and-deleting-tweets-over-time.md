Long-term Twitter accounts need a routine that keeps content aligned with current goals. DeleteTweets (https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets) supports that routine with filters, automated deletions, backups, and exports—all running in your browser to preserve privacy.

> **Goal:** Maintain a clean, on-brand timeline without endless manual work.

## The workflow
1. **Plan cadence:** Decide on a monthly or quarterly cleanup based on how often you post.
2. **Segment by type:** Run separate passes for tweets, retweets, replies, and likes to stay organized.
3. **Filter smartly:** Combine date windows, keywords, engagement levels, and custom conditions to target what matters.
4. **Back up first:** Create a backup and rely on automatic archives of deleted tweets.
5. **Automate deletion:** Click delete once; the extension searches and removes all matches for you.
6. **Export records:** Download backups for offline storage and reporting.

## Tips for ongoing success
- Keep a recurring calendar reminder to run your filters.
- Rotate keywords to match current campaigns or topics.
- Review backups quarterly to understand which themes you consistently remove.
