Clearing a large backlog of tweets can feel risky if you worry about account restrictions. DeleteTweets (https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets) minimizes that risk by running entirely in your browser and simulating normal user actions. You stay within expected patterns while still removing tweets, retweets, replies, and likes at scale.

> **Safety first:** Browser-side actions, smart pacing, and backups help you delete confidently.

## Why browser-side deletion is safer
- **No external data access:** The extension doesn’t need your account data; it works through the same interface you do.
- **Human-like pacing:** Actions mirror regular user behavior to avoid sudden spikes.
- **Full control:** Filters let you segment work into smaller batches instead of deleting everything at once.

## Safe high-volume workflow
1. Open https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets and choose the tweet type to delete.
2. Set filters (date, keyword, engagement, or custom) to limit each pass.
3. Create a backup and archive deleted tweets for reference.
4. Start deletion. The extension handles search and removal automatically in-browser.
5. Take short breaks between large batches if you’re clearing tens of thousands of posts.
6. Export your backup to keep a local record of what changed.

## Best practices to avoid restrictions
- Run smaller date windows (e.g., six months at a time) to keep activity steady.
- Use keywords to prioritize sensitive topics first.
- Monitor progress and pause between runs instead of pushing nonstop activity.

Delete at scale without anxiety. Start a safe cleanup with DeleteTweets: https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets.
