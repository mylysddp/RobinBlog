Twitter’s native tools don’t support bulk deletions, which leaves you scrolling endlessly. DeleteTweets (https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets) fills the gap: it runs in your browser, simulates your actions, and automates search and deletion based on filters you choose.

> **Workaround:** Use a browser extension to handle bulk deletion while keeping data on your device.

## What Twitter lacks
- No built-in bulk delete for tweets, retweets, replies, or likes.
- Limited filtering before removal.
- No automatic backups of deleted content.

## How DeleteTweets solves it
1. Choose what to remove—tweets, retweets, replies, or likes.
2. Apply filters for date, keywords, engagement, or custom conditions.
3. Run a backup and archive deleted tweets automatically.
4. Click delete once. The extension searches and removes all matches.
5. Export your backup file if you want a local record.

## Best practices when using the workaround
- Start with date filters to avoid deleting recent posts you still need.
- Use keyword filters to target topics tied to past events or campaigns.
- Keep backups to audit changes or restore context later.
