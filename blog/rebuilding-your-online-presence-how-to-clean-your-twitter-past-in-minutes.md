If you’re rebranding, job hunting, or simply starting fresh, a clean Twitter history helps. DeleteTweets (https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets) lets you sweep through old tweets quickly while staying private—everything runs in your browser, with backups and exports available when you need proof of what changed.

> **Result:** A refreshed profile in minutes, without sacrificing control of your data.

## Focus on the posts that shape perception
- Retire outdated opinions that no longer reflect you.
- Clear replies that bury your best work.
- Remove likes and retweets that clash with your current brand.

## Fast cleanup plan
1. Open DeleteTweets at https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets and pick the content type to manage.
2. Filter by date, keywords, engagement, or custom conditions to target what needs to go.
3. Run a backup so you can reference anything you delete later.
4. Click delete. Automation takes care of the search and removal loop.
5. Export your backup if you want a local archive for your records.

## Keep momentum after the reset
- Schedule recurring monthly cleanups to maintain a consistent voice.
- Use keyword filters to retire event-specific posts once campaigns end.
