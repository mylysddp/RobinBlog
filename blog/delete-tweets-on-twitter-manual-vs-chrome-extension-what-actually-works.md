Deleting tweets manually is fine for a handful of posts, but it falls apart at scale. The DeleteTweets extension (https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets) brings filtering, automation, and backups to the process, handling tweets, retweets, replies, and likes without leaving your browser.

> **Bottom line:** Manual works for small edits; DeleteTweets works when you have hundreds or thousands to clear.

## Manual deletion
- **Pros:** No setup, works for a few tweets.
- **Cons:** Time-consuming, easy to miss posts, no backups, limited filtering, and you must scroll endlessly.

## Chrome extension approach
- **Filters first:** Date, keyword, engagement, and custom conditions.
- **Type control:** Target tweets, retweets, replies, or likes separately.
- **Automation:** One click handles search and deletion at scale.
- **Safety nets:** Backups and exports keep a record of what changed.
- **Privacy:** Actions stay in your browser; no external account access.

## Choose the right method
1. If you’re cleaning fewer than 20 tweets, manual is fine.
2. For larger jobs or regular maintenance, open https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets.
3. Set filters, back up, and delete in one automated run.
4. Export your backup if you want a local archive.

Spend less time clicking and more time creating. Try the extension at https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets.
