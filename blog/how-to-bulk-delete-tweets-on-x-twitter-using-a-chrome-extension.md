Bulk deleting tweets on X (Twitter) is easiest when you let a browser tool handle the heavy lifting. DeleteTweets (https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets) is a Chrome extension that runs entirely in your browser, simulating your normal actions while keeping your account data private. You choose what to delete—tweets, retweets, replies, or likes—and the extension processes them in batches.

> **Promise:** Finish bulk deletions faster with automation, precise filters, and built-in backups.

## Why choose a Chrome extension for bulk deletion
- **No API hassles:** DeleteTweets simulates your own deletion clicks, avoiding API limits and privacy worries.
- **Full control:** Pick tweet types, date ranges, keywords, or engagement levels before you delete.
- **Safety nets:** Back up and export everything you clear so you can restore context later.

## Step-by-step bulk deletion
1. Install DeleteTweets from https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets and open the extension.
2. Select the type of content to remove: tweets, retweets, replies, or likes.
3. Add filters—date range, keywords, engagement metrics, or your own custom conditions.
4. Create a backup so you keep a record of what will be deleted.
5. Click delete. The extension searches and removes all matches automatically while you monitor progress.
6. Export your backup file if you want a local archive.

## Tips for smoother bulk runs
- Start with a narrower date range to verify your filters, then expand to older tweets.
- Combine keywords with engagement filters to target viral posts that no longer fit your brand.
- Schedule periodic runs so your timeline stays clean without manual effort.
