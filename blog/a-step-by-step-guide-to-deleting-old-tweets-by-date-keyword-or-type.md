If you want precise control over what stays on your Twitter profile, the DeleteTweets extension (https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets) gives you granular filters before you remove anything. You can target posts by date, keywords, engagement, or specific types like replies and retweets—then back up the results for peace of mind.

> **Takeaway:** Filter first, back up, then delete with one click—all inside your browser.

## Decide what to keep and what to remove
- **Date-based cleanup:** Remove tweets before or after a specific date to keep your timeline current.
- **Keyword targeting:** Exclude topics you no longer endorse by matching words or phrases.
- **Type-based control:** Focus on replies, retweets, original tweets, or likes to reduce clutter.
- **Engagement filters:** Combine likes, replies, or retweets thresholds with your keyword or date rules.

## Step-by-step with DeleteTweets
1. Open DeleteTweets at https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets and pick the tweet type to manage.
2. Set your date window (e.g., before a job change) and add keywords to include or avoid.
3. Layer on engagement filters or custom conditions to refine the list.
4. Create a backup of the targeted tweets for reference.
5. Hit delete. The extension searches and clears everything that matches your criteria automatically.
6. Export the backup file if you want a local archive of what changed.

## Pro tips
- Start with keywords that match sensitive topics, then broaden to older date ranges.
- Use a saved backup as a changelog when you run new filters later.
- Alternate between type-based runs (e.g., likes first, then replies) to stay organized.
