Running an active Bluesky account should not require endless scrolling to remove outdated posts or experiments. BskyDelete (https://bskydelete.com/) is my answer to that problem: a focused tool for bulk-deleting or archiving Bluesky content while keeping you in control.

> **Goal:** Finish a full cleanup session in minutes—not hours—while seeing exactly what will be removed before you confirm.

## Why I built BskyDelete
I wanted a reliable way to tidy my feed without giving up privacy or spending hours clicking through old posts. Existing options were either unreliable or too manual, so I built an approach that is:

- **Fast**: Scan large timelines quickly and select posts in batches.
- **Safe**: Uses secure authentication and lets you preview before deletion.
- **Flexible**: Choose filters by date or keyword so you only remove what you truly want gone.

## Key features
- Bulk selection with clear confirmation steps to prevent accidents.
- Optional export so you can keep a backup before deleting.
- Lightweight interface designed to finish a cleanup session in minutes, not hours.

## Quick start
1. Visit https://bskydelete.com/ and sign in with your Bluesky account.
2. Apply date or keyword filters to surface posts you want to remove.
3. Preview the batch, export a backup if you like, and confirm the deletion.

**Pro tip:** Try running a monthly cleanup with a 90-day filter so your profile stays fresh without losing your recent updates.
