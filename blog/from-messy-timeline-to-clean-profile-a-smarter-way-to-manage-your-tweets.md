A messy timeline makes it harder for followers to see your best work. DeleteTweets (https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets) turns cleanup into a smarter workflow: filter by date or keywords, focus on specific tweet types, and let the extension automate deletions while keeping backups on hand.

> **Smarter management:** You set the rules, automation executes them, and backups preserve your history.

## What makes this workflow smart
- **Precision filters:** Target by time, keywords, engagement, or custom conditions.
- **Type awareness:** Separate runs for tweets, retweets, replies, and likes to stay organized.
- **Automated execution:** One click triggers search and deletion without manual scrolling.
- **Backup-first:** Archive deleted tweets and export backups for later reference.

## Cleanup steps
1. Go to https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets and pick the tweet type to manage.
2. Add filters—date ranges, keywords, or engagement levels—to define what should go.
3. Back up the selection and keep deleted tweets archived automatically.
4. Click delete. The extension processes every match while you watch progress.
5. Export your backup if you want a local record of the changes.

## Keep your profile clean
- Schedule recurring cleanups after major campaigns or product launches.
- Use engagement filters to remove outdated promotions with high impressions.
- Store backups by month so you can track how your profile evolves.
