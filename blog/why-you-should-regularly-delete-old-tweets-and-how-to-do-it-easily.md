Regular tweet cleanups keep your timeline focused on what matters today. DeleteTweets (https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets) makes the routine simple: filter by date or keywords, decide which types to remove, back everything up, and automate the deletion—all inside your browser with no data leaving your device.

> **Core idea:** A monthly cleanup improves relevance, reduces risk, and takes only a few clicks.

## Why regular deletion matters
- **Relevance:** Retire old takes that no longer match your brand or goals.
- **Privacy:** Shrink your public data trail by clearing stale replies and likes.
- **Clarity:** Make it easier for new followers to understand your current focus.

## Simple recurring workflow
1. Visit https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets and pick tweets, retweets, replies, or likes.
2. Set a rolling date window (e.g., older than 90 days) and add keywords to avoid or target.
3. Run a backup and archive deleted tweets for accountability.
4. Click delete once—automation handles the search and removal.
5. Export your backup if you want a local record of each cycle.
