You don’t need a pricey subscription to tidy thousands of tweets. DeleteTweets (https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets) is free to use for searching, filtering, and deleting, and it runs entirely in your browser. You stay in control while clearing tweets, retweets, replies, and likes with one-click automation.

> **Highlight:** Free filtering and deletion with optional backups—no recurring fees required.

## What you get for free
- **Unlimited search and filters:** Narrow by time, keywords, engagement, and custom rules.
- **Multi-type deletion:** Remove tweets, retweets, replies, or likes in one session.
- **Automation included:** One click runs the search and deletion loop for you.
- **Local privacy:** Actions simulate your own clicks; no account data leaves your device.

## When to consider Pro
- **Backups and exports:** Save deleted tweets to revisit later or keep an archive.
- **Faster auditing:** Having a backup makes it easier to justify what changed to a team or client.

## Quick cleanup workflow
1. Open DeleteTweets at https://taskease.info/DeleteTweets.
2. Choose the tweet type and set filters by date, keyword, or engagement level.
3. (Optional) Run a backup if you want a record before deleting.
4. Hit delete once. Automation finds and removes every match.
5. Export your backup if you upgraded to Pro and want a local copy.

## Save time without spending
- Batch older promotions first, then clear outdated replies.
- Use keyword filters to remove posts tied to past events you no longer need.
- Repeat monthly to avoid large, time-consuming purges.
